# lead

This is a perl wrapper around rsync to make backups easier. Because
backups should be *easy*.

## Documentation

There's embedded POD in the script - try `perldoc ./lead`, or if you
prefer man pages `pod2man ./lead | man -l /dev/stdin`.

## Dependencies

The script requires rsync and the List::MoreUtils and Config::Tiny
perl modules.

## Name

It's a *p*erl *b*ackup script. `Pb` is the chemical symbol for Lead,
the 82nd element.
